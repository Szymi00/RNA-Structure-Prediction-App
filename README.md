# Application for predicting the secondary structure of RNA using Nussinov's Algorithm
# Motivation
The objective of this project was to develop a functional desktop application capable of predicting RNA secondary structures based on user-input RNA sequences. My interest in bioinformatics during my engineering studies prompted me to choose this topic for my diploma thesis. I encountered various existing solutions to RNA folding problems, each with its own set of features. To address this, I consolidated these different approaches and integrated them into a comprehensive application. Some of the key functionalities include: support for GU pairs, customizable settings for the minimal number of nucleotides in loops, detailed information on specific loop types, visualization of secondary structures using dot-bracket notation, and the representation of flat graphs.
These features were designed to offer users a versatile tool for RNA structure prediction, catering to a wide range of research and practical applications in bioinformatics
